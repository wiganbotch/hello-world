# hello-world
First Repository
This is a readme file for my 'First Repository'.
The purpose of the repository is to learn about Git Hub.
So far I have:

* Created a Git Hub account (wiganbotch)
* Created a repository (hello-world)
* Created a new branch (readme-edits)
* Edited this file in the new branch
* Commited the changes to the new branch
